## Summary

Spotter was developed as my capstone personal project for DevMountain *Fullstack Web Development* course. It is built using ReactJS, NodeJS (using Express), Redux, PostgreSQL, and Auth0 for authentication. It utilized LeafletJS to create maps for viewing, editing, and creating activities. It is being hosted by Digital Ocean. A link to the live project is [here](https://spotter.jfirwin.com "Spotter Hosted") and a link to the GitHub repository is [here](https://github.com/jfirwin/devmountain-personal-project).

## Lessons Learned

I learned a few lessons in this project. Let's review

> I haven't even scratched the surface of what LeafletJS can do.

I really want to sink my teeth into a couple more projects and really learn how to use this API. From the time that I started the project to the time that I finished it, I could tell that there were a few things that I had set up wrong initially. I went back and fixed most of those things, but some were too engrained to make the changes in time for my deadline. **Reminder: Read the docs thoroughly!**

> There's no such thing as excess planning.

Going into this project I thought that I had a super in depth plan of how I was going to execute the project. But it's easy to get sucked into a project and continue to write prolific code to fix the problem. Next project I want to step back and take a breath, then write the cleanest code I possibly can.

## Accomplishments

Really I just felt super proud of how my edit page turned out. I didn't make this project responsive, and it's not particularly mobile friendly, but with a little more time, this project could become a really cool tool.
