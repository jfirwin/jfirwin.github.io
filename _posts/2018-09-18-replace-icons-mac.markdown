Did you know that on your Mac you aren't just stuck to using the same old boring icons everyone else uses? Apple even has a support guide to help you [here](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/create-custom-icons-for-files-or-folders-mchlp2313/mac)! It's super easy.

### Copy Image to Clipboard

One way to do this is:

- Get the image that you would like to use and open it up in Preview.
- Select All (⌘A)
- Copy (⌘C)

### Select Desired File or Folder

- Select "Get Info" from Right Click Menu
- Click on the image at the top of the info box so that it is highlighted in blue
- Paste (⌘V)

### Change it back

Decided that your custom image isn't quite all you hoped and dreamed? That's ok, it's really easy to change it back.

- Select "Get Info"
- Click the image so it's highlighted
- Cut (⌘X)

That's it! Super simple custom icons!
