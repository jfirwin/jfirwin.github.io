Hi! My name is Foster Irwin. I love Utah and the outdoors. I've always liked knowing how things work and programming has offered me a whole world of material that I can sink my teeth into. I might not know how to do everything, but I'm willing to learn it all. I'm interested bicycles, rock climbing, paddleboarding and DIY projects. I love reading, even though blog posts have snuck in and stolen the spotlight from good old fashion books. I have a Kindle that I use sometimes, but I get trapped reading short stories. Programming is where I have laser focus. I love solving problems and figuring out solutions to problems that I didn't even knew existed.

Thanks for checking out my website. Make sure to stop by my [Portfolio](/porfolio) & [Blog](/blog) to see what it is that I'm doing. [Contact](/contact) me if you are interested in working together, or if you have any questions!
